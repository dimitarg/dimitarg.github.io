I am a functional programmer based off Sofia, Bulgaria (the beautiful Ruse on the migthy Danube is my hometown). Professionally, I am interesred in everything which can enable us to build less broken software.

I juggle my personal time between running, mountaneering, kayaking, singing, listening to music, stuff like that. And pubs. Of course.
