I'm in the market for a new placement. You can fetch my CV [here](../assets/docs/Dimitar_Georgiev_Resume.pdf).

I am primarily looking at positions where expertise in functional programming is required. The reasons for this are two-fold:

- I believe this is the most productive and practical way our industry currently has of building software;
- I would like to protect my existing, several-year investment in studying functional programming, therefore I would prefer to work on a project where I can continue to improve my skills in this area.

In practice this would mean I'm looking for roles where Scala is the main language used; I am also very interested in positions where the main languages are Haskell and Purescript, and it's okay to pick up those languages on the job (I have preliminary experience with Haskell, am somewhat comfortable with the syntax, and have working knowledge of some of the abstractions used to write haskell programs.)

On the infrastructure side of things, I am productive working with GCP / GKE, comfortable working with AWS, and know my way around infrastructure-as-code tools, software deployment tools, monitoring and service management tools.

I am comfortable and enjoy owning all parts of the software development lifecycle, including operating software in production and managing and resolving incidents.

I am a good communicator, an easy-going person and have experience being productive in a distributed, remote team.

In terms of placement I am looking for fully remote positions, with occasional travel if needed. I prefer contract-based arrangements, but can do either contract or perm depending on what suits your needs best. I am based in Bulgaria which is a member state of the EU, and am therefore eligible to work in the EU.
