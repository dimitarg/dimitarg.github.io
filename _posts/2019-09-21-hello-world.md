I've been on a short sabbatical of sorts for almost two months now. During that time I completed the [Kom-Emine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kom–Emine) mountain trail, had a very short but extremely fun stay at Karadere, wandered around my [hometown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NZWB1FzkPI) a little bit ...

... Went to [Kassandra](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mýti+Pose%C3%ADdou+Beach/@39.9539642,23.3562012,3a,75y,29.68h,90t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipMsy54NIgxyrkq9Hg1I2kapJkbgCwWv6mvHMGf5!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMsy54NIgxyrkq9Hg1I2kapJkbgCwWv6mvHMGf5%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya29.68347-ro-0-fo100!7i8192!8i4096!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a7cd68032e2afd:0x91de149e71c49401!8m2!3d39.9563299!4d23.3583062) with dear friends, where I discovered it can be a challenging and sligtly eerie experience to be the only single person in your 30's in a party with six little ones ...

Had an amazing, impromptu kayaking and camping trip on the Danube ...

Then mostly stuck around my beloved, chaotic routine of running, working out, singing, seeing friends, listening to music, going to pubs ... all in all, doing nothing much, really. 

Which is a routine I thoroughly recommend!

But now, as the date at which I must return to my regular, bread-earning life looms, I felt that I should do something a little bit productive. I've always wanted to start a blog, so here it is. Hello, world!

This is mostly planned to be a blog focused around programming, but who knows. One piece of knowledge Kom-Emine reinforced in me is that plans are bound to fail, and new ones arise as circumstance unveils. Surely, I will talk about functional programming in this Refuge, but who knows - one day you might find reports about amateur singing here.

Stay tuned for the next blog post, where I try to explain, and hopefully motivate, to all you non-programmers out there, what it is that I do for a living.

Cheers!
