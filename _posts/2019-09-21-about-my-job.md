Hopefully this post will not show up yet, as "published" is set to "false".

In this post, I will attempt to explain, in what hopefully are simple terms, what is it that I do for a living, and why I feel passionate about it. You do not need to be a programmer to follow along this text - it is non-technical.

# Why?

Doctors will be able to explain to you, in a sentence or two, what it is that they do, and why they picked that profession, and why they are sticking with it. So will musicians, architects, farmers ... The list goes on.

We programmers, on the other hand, are notoriously bad at explaining things. And so, our trade looks shrouded in a dark cloud of wizardry. What most people know about me is that I "do something with computers". I want to attempt to fix this.

**I feel the urge to try and explain this for my own sake.**

Not everyone is a programmer. And, as it happens, even among programmers, relatively few are into the exact sorts of programming that I am.
And so, there is this huge part of my life, and huge part of my passion, that is mostly inaccessible to the people around me; and worse,  inaccessible to the people closest to me.

Sometimes this makes me feel a bit lonely, isolated and sad. And so I wanted to remedy this, if a little bit.

# I am a programmer

This means I help create software systems such as the ones that you use every day. Right now (well, not *right* now, I still have a week of vacation left), I work on a [mobile app](https://www.boostpower.co.uk) people use to pay for their electricity and gas.

If you wish to draw an analogy from construction, I am Bob the builder, the construction engineer, and the architect (of sorts) at the same time.

I know *how* to build software. Well, this may be a bit pretentious. It's more of a continuous process: I build software, and simultaneously hone my skills and knowledge, so that I always learn how to do it better.

One thing I do not necessarily know is *what* software to build. This is usually a separate job for a separate person, called a product manager / product owner. Product magagers and programmers work together; one thing they have in common is aptitude for analytical thinking, but otherwise the skillsets required to do the two jobs are quite different.
 

# I am a functional programmer

> Wut?

, I hear you say. Alright, let's take a step back.

# Software sucks

I've a bit of a side story from a couple of weeks ago.
