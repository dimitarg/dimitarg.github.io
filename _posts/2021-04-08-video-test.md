This post is just here to demo to my friend Ivo how we can embed youtube videos
in jekyll posts.

This is really easy since, apparently, we're allowed to just write html inside the markdown and it will be included as-is in the final output.

I just get the embed `html` from the youtube share link and paste it here directly.

I hope you like the tune dude, it's a favourite of mine!
